Title: Weather Application (Java Servlets and JSP)

Description:
This Java Servlet-based web application provides real-time weather information by fetching data from an online API server. 
Users can input a city name and receive the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant details.

2. API integration: Fetches weather data from an online API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, Weather.com).
3. Dynamic content: Displays weather information based on user input.
4. Error handling: Handles API errors and invalid city names gracefully.

Prerequisites:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
2. Servlet container (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty)
3. Required Java libraries (e.g., JSON processing, HTTP client)
4. An online weather API account (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)
